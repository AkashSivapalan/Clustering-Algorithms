# Clustering-Algorithms

This exercise performs the k-means, nearest neighbour, and dbscan algorithms coded from scratch to cluster two datasets. One small dataset with 2 inputs and 1 large 300 sample dataset with 9 features of inputs to determine if 
coronary heart disease is present in a sample. These algorthms coded from scratch are verified using the sklearn imports as shown in at the botton of the file. Assumptions are listed in the notes at the botton of the file.
